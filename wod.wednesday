Wednesday - WOD

"Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant" - Robert Louis Stevenson

Today is rest and recovery day. 
Do something that would benefit you mentally, emotionally, or spiritually. 
This may be as simple as taking a nap.

You will hit it again tomorrow.
